I enjoyed every discussion with him, as it was an opportunity to learn something new, especially about emerging technologies, which helped us deliver better solutions. Arun was approachable and attentive to our concerns, and his work on LLM solutions was truly inspiring. His dedication motivated me to contribute to developing impactful products that could be widely utilized.


I've known Raju for the past few months during our efforts to provision data in CCB Snowflake. He carefully listened to our suggestions and proposed the best approach that would allow both the CCB and CCB Risk teams to reach an agreement. Whenever we had questions, he addressed them thoughtfully, providing answers that satisfied everyone. I'm grateful to have a partner like him on the ABC Snowflake team, ensuring the successful integration of ABCD data into Snowflake.


Swathi is a colleague on our team and my go-to person whenever I have questions about the data model or catalog-related information. She patiently explains the process.  I've been part of the data model discussions, and it's clear that everyone relies on her expertise during working sessions to understand the DRB process and she will provide the answer, no matter how the basic the question might be. She has also established a structured approach to ensure everyone follows the DRB calls effectively.
