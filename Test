I have a field eff_date and part_date both will have populated as a business date value, when the file is loaded in to s3. Eff_datr is part of parquet file and partition_date is a partition folder where that parquet file is present. Currently business familiarize in using the field eff,_date, and the query will take time .  Since partition date, eff date both it has same value, we can display the eff_dt from partition date, so that if business use eff_dt also performance will be good, only thing is every time the date to sting conversion will happen, but it will happen in milli second.

Sure, here's a rephrased version of your explanation:

The eff_date field and the partition_date both hold the same business date value when the file is loaded into S3. The eff_date is part of the Parquet file, while the partition_date is in the partition folder containing that Parquet file. Currently, the business is accustomed to using the eff_date field in queries, which can impact performance. Since both partition_date and eff_date have the same value, we can display eff_date using partition_date. This approach improves performance because the partition_date can be accessed more efficiently. Although this requires converting the date to a string each time, the conversion occurs in milliseconds, so the impact on performance is minimal.
